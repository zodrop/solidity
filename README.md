Basic lottery game in solidity


# Solidity Sample Script: Lottery Game
Overview:
The following Solidity contract demonstrates basic functionality of a simple lottery game.


# Key Features:
Add Player Functionality: Users can join the lottery game by sending ether.
Array Management: The contract uses a dynamic array to store player addresses.
Security Considerations:

This implementation includes basic security checks such as verifying sender's balance before proceeding further ensuring no unexpected behavior during execution.

Usage Example:
lottery.addPlayer().value(1e18); // Join the lottery game with 1 ether.

Note that you should adjust the pragma solidity version according to your needs.

This script demonstrates a simple use case for Solidity contracts. For more complex applications, consider implementing additional features like ticket prices and participation limits.

Security Considerations:
This contract does not prevent users from sending arbitrary amounts of Ether.
It also doesn't enforce any rules regarding ticket prices or participation limits.
To make this lottery game more secure and robust consider implementing the following measures:

Ticket Price Enforcement: Set a specific price for each ticket, preventing players from buying multiple tickets at once.
Participation Limits: Establish caps on the number of participants allowed in each round.
Implementing these features will significantly enhance overall security and fairness throughout your lottery game setup
